A testing patch for experimental concepts and tweaks, based on AOW2 r3579. Basically where all the crazy shit goes that I'm afraid to put in the main
game.
Fullscreen this .txt to avoid having to scroll sideways.

At this time nothing in this branch is done or near done. Lots needs to be finished.

///////////////////////
//// Other Changes ////
///////////////////////

[*] [PLANNED] Refining gives 20% less profits when Enh Ref is researched.
[*] [PLANNED] Armour types no longer have any weaknesses, whatsoever: only strengths. The thing is the armor system's balance goes out the window when
you realize that it's easy to get bullet and explosive weapons for any class. An entry in TVTrope's "Fake Balance" article:
"This results in a practice known as "counter-picking", where a player makes their choice based on the other player's choice. This naturally leads to
all players hiding their choices and making the game feel like an elaborate version of Rock-Paper-Scissors played before instead of whatever actual
gameplay was intended, determining the outcome of the game before it starts."
With this setup, the game will only tell you what NOT to use, not "you MUST use THIS to have the best chances, no creativity allowed!"
[*] [PLANNED] Buildings are to generally be far more vulnerable to fire damage, giving flamethrowers and Titan flamers a powerful if risky tiebreaker
to defeat turtled buildings. This is because enough repairers can outdamage a ton of arty shells and rockets from afar. If the turtlers get beat deep
enough to let Titans/Flamethrowers get within flamerushing distance, they have the option to do a ton more damage than explosives while sacrificing
the infinite range explosives have. 
[*] [PLANNED] Util turrets are to have limited ranges, 1.25x more health, and have minimum-space requirements like Portals do. They also cannot be
placed within a certain radius of each other.
[*] [PLANNED] When building Mini-Refineries/Portals/Turrets in a place where they cannot spawn, a green holographic sprite will be used instead of the
green.
[*] [PLANNED] Armour switching no longer has an "equip time". Activating the item immediately announces "fire/chemical proof" and switches your armour.
[*] [PLANNED] Damage from fire/tiberium damagetypes are to have their own sound, because loldelta12
[*] [PLANNED] Planting Ion Cannon/Nuclear Strike beacons is different. To plant, one must not move and activate the beacon item. From this point on,
the player is not locked from movement, but the old armour-switching meter is used for the beacon-planting process (4 seconds). If the player moves
while this meter is incomplete, the beacon will be cancelled and can be attempted again. This system is used in Renegade.
[*] [PLANNED] Credits have a default cap at $10,000. Any more is seriously overkill.


//////////////////////////////////
//// Infantry Weapons Changes ////
//////////////////////////////////

[*] [PLANNED] All weapons switch at double the speed. High priority.
[*] [PLANNED] Two free/cheap classes of energy and explosive damage:
	[*] The Engineer would get a Energy Pistol, where it would fire smaller, faster, weaker plasma gun projectiles in a three-round burst with minor
	spread. Technicians would get this weapon as well as the standard SMG. This would make them the basic, free energy classes as well as basic
	repairmen.
[*] [PLANNED] Riot Control class: 350$, has a shotgun and a riot shield, a 'la the Allied Peacekeeper. You're only really paying for the shield.
Primary fires the shotgun, and the shield would be raised and lowered by holding altfire, shielding damage from the front while reducing player speed.
Weapons with splash damage and obviously area-of-effect weapons can obviously not be directly blocked.
[*] [PLANNED] Shotgun's spread reduced from 5.5° to 5.25°.
[*] [PLANNED] SMG is full-auto only, but fires faster with much reduced accuracy. Can be tap-fired like the machinegun for higher accuracy.
[*] [PLANNED] Pistol has full-retard spraying altfire for pointblank combat. Basically, think full-auto glock with a limp wrist. This will
also result in way too much heat for the little gun very quickly, and the barrel will visibly glow red as it heats up. Fire too much, and glocknade!
(Or you could be boring and just make it lock itself, a la Plasma Rifle)
[*] [PLANNED] Plasma rifle is to have its tip visibly glow red when heating up. Another side to it is possibly losing accuracy as it fires, as well.
As a compensation, the projectiles themselves fly a tad (10%) faster.
[*] [PLANNED] Sniper rifle's responsiveness increased by many user's request. The rifle scopes in instantly upon right click, and unscoping is also
instant. However, the black fade-in/out is still there to combat "quickscoping". The weapon can also be switched during the reloading sequence,
reducing clunkiness.
[*] [PLANNED] Full-auto Machinegun spread increased from 4.5° to 4.75°.
[*] [PLANNED] All laser weapons can leave fire decays.
[*] [PLANNED] Laser Rifle damage reduced from 16 to 14, partly because of the likely burning damage.
[*] [PLANNED] Laser Chaingun becomes an essentially double-speed laser rifle with 2° spread. Though it fires slower than 2539, it hits harder and
functions as a decent mech killer on the side.
[*] [PLANNED] Heal Gun renamed to Healing Tool.
[*] [PLANNED] BFG2704 deducts health upon release of attack, instead of afterwards.
[*] [PLANNED] Fists are deleted, all classes get a knife. Knife gets a low-ish damage "poke" primary attack and a buffed long slash as an altfire.
[*] [PLANNED] Combustion Autorifle fires full auto at half speed, with no spread. Projectiles fly at 75% speed but deal 1.25x damage. This is similar
to the real Tibrifle from Ren and diffrentiates itself from the other autorifle "clone". Secondary is a 5-projectile 5.5° randomized shotgun attack
with 4 second cooldown after shooting. There is no "weak" version.
[*] [PLANNED] Tiberium Autorifle remains unchanged in function. There is no weak version, however it fires a burst of 5 rounds before needing to
reload. Altfire shoots two smaller smaller shards per one ammo, at twice the fire rate, which fly at double speed and do half damage. This is for when
the rifle needs to reach longer ranges with accuracy at the expense of damage.
[*] [PLANNED] Shock Rifle acts as a beam weapon: It fires a stream of 100% accurate hitscans (and cosmetic special effect actors), each doing minor
damage but adding up to a high DPS within this medium-short range. These would have a short range, and drain ammo supplies very rapidly along with
ammo packs not restocking much, emphasizing ammo efficiency and accuracy. The price would be adjusted to 700$ or 800$, being in around the same tier
as Plasma Troopers.
[*] [PLANNED] Jumpjet is to be revamped. Armed with one (or two) SMGs (or an AC-2?) modified to fire faster, mounted on the arm(s) of his jetpack:
he can tap fire for short, accurate airborne attacks or let loose with an full-auto flurry of inaccurate fury pointblank. Flight is controlled by
altfire, where tapping it will use a sizeable portion of fuel to blast the user upwards in a jet powered boost jump. Holding the button will allow the
user to slowly float downwards while steadily consuming fuel. The user can press altfire again in midair to boost jump again and gain height if desired,
though trying to attain high heights by purely boosting will consume a lot of fuel from all the boost jumps. In this way, rapid up-down vertical
movement cannot be used as a means to abuse Doom's poor vertical aiming mechanics while allowing some midair agility, which is its sole purpose for
existing. Altfire does not interfere with the gun's function.
The downsides? The compacted, modified guns can't dissipate heat as well as their full-size counterparts, so prolonged W+M1 fire is not an option. The
bullets don't hit hard individually, and the gun itself loses accuracy very quickly to after a handful of shots. This means sneaking up vertically (up
cliffs and jumping over cover) is a great strategy, where their foe is within their effective range long enough for them to gun them down, and where
they have many escape routes available to them.
Second, their fuel runs out very quickly through heavy use, though it regenerates on its own fast enough to keep it effective if moderated.
Third, when they're not dashing about midair, the jetpack itself is pretty heavy and the guy's fairly slow on foot.
I'd expect this class to be the "elite" bullet class like Shock/Plasma troops (or if fitted with an AC-2 or two, the "elite" explosive class), and be
priced accordingly: $700-$800.


////////////////////////////////////////
//// Mechs and Mech Weapons Changes ////
////////////////////////////////////////


[*] Titans, Madcats, and Juggernauts recieve a 10% speed boost: otherwise they're just plain helpless to a single arty guy.
[*] Orca's "stomps" do far less damage. Keep your distance, for mindlessly ramming marines with the nose of your Orca while holding M1 will do you
no good.
[*] [PLANNED] Mech stomp, idle, and LRM sounds edited.
[*] [PLANNED] Ejecting will have an armour-switch styled delay of 2 seconds, and not have the launch seat.
[*] [PLANNED] All mechs have their health cut to 1/4th. That's 250 for Orcas, 500 for Ravens, 750 for Wolverines, 875 for Tortoises, 1000 for Madcats,
and 1250 for Titans and Juggernauts.
[*] [PLANNED] However, their armour resists 50% more damage (besides anti-mech weapons, to which they resist 60% damage). Basically what this means is
all weapons get a 25% damage buff against mechs, while anti-mech ones 10%.
[*] [PLANNED] LRMs hit harder, but have an arc to compensate. Effectively giving them a limited range against buildings, helping against base sniping
from across the map.

>> Ravens:
[*] AC-2 fires twice as fast, but half as powerful, closer mirroring its MW counterpart. Radius/height adjusted from 4/8 to 5/10.
[*] AC-2 has a 1° horiz spread when firing in single shots, but full-auto increases this to 2° horiz/1° vert.
[*] AC-2 maximum ammo raised from 120 to 200. Overall won't last as long as vanilla Raven.
[*] LRM-5 launcher is the only one with no spread (all others have 1°/1°), allowing it to harass slower targets from a distance.

>> Wolverines:
[*] [PLANNED] Miniguns do not fire full speed immediately. They must be allowed to spin faster to reach full firepower capacity, but W+M1ing is
not the way to win: firing full-speed burns ammo like no tomorrow and can't be done for long before running dry. The sheer amount of bullets even
makes it a decent anti-air weapon.
[*] [Planned] Pulse gun fires at 1/2 speed, but projectiles fly at 2x speed.
[*] LRM-10s fire from other arm.

>> Madcats:
[*] [PLANNED] Twin arm-mounted 20-damage medium lasers instead of twin shock rifles with minor (5) splash. The impacts of these lasers would leave
flames from sheer heat.
[*] LRM-20s visibly fire from shoulder pods properly.

>> Titans:
[*] [PLANNED] 100mm cannon sound changed, 100mm now fires from offset similar to cannon on sprite, 100mm shell damage buffed from 374 to 390 w/
more gentle damage curve.
[*] LRM-20s fire from shoulders.

>> Guardians:
[*] [PLANNED] Cannons are now like highly modified Titan guns, with 20% lower speed and power per shell, and focus nearly ALL their power into
direct hit. Their splash damage is minimal (armour-piercing instead of high-explosive shells Titans use).

>> Orcas:
[*] Maximum machine gun ammunition reduced to 400 and base damage reduced from 7 to 6.
[*] [PLANNED/UNFINISHED] Instead of single-shot dumbfire rockets, the Orca is now equipped with twin heavy missile pods, each with 20 missiles.
Pressing fire will unload a barrage of 10 missiles (like LRMs but more powerful), and they can home in. Four high-damage barrages and it's back to
base for a refill, making the Orca both a gunship and a bomber.
